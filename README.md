## Actions and Recommendations

### **1. Increase Conversion Rates**

Consider seasonal promotions or personalized campaigns during peak months like January and September to maximize these trends.

### **2. Enhance Customer Engagement**
- **Revitalize Content Strategy:** To improve engagement, experiment with more interactive content formats such as videos and user-generated content. Additionally, optimize the placement of calls-to-action in social media posts and blog content, particularly during lower-engagement periods (e.g., September to December).

### **3. Improve Customer Feedback Scores**
- **Address Mixed and Negative Feedback:** Implement a feedback loop to analyze mixed and negative reviews, identifying recurring issues. Develop improvement plans to address customer concerns, and consider following up with dissatisfied customers to resolve issues and encourage re-rating to achieve an average rating closer to the 4.0 target.
