## Actions and Recommendations

### **1. Increase Conversion Rates**
- **Target High-Performing Product Categories:** Focus marketing efforts on products with demonstrated high conversion rates, such as Kayaks, Ski Boots, and Baseball Gloves. Consider seasonal promotions or personalized campaigns during peak months like January and September to maximize these trends.

### **2. Enhance Customer Engagement**
- **Revitalise Content Strategy:** To improve engagement, experiment with more interactive content formats such as videos and user-generated content. Additionally, optimise the placement of calls-to-action in social media posts and blog content, particularly during lower-engagement periods (e.g., September to December).

### **3. Improve Customer Feedback Scores**
- **Address Mixed and Negative Feedback:** Implement a feedback loop to analyse mixed and negative reviews, identifying recurring issues. Develop improvement plans to address customer concerns, and consider following up with dissatisfied customers to resolve issues and encourage re-rating to achieve an average rating closer to the 4.0 target.
